# Pyramid of Pain: Hash value, IP address, Domain Names, Network, Tools, TTP
## Hash Values (Trival)
-> Hashing algorithm - MD5(Messege Digest, Defined by RFC 1321 Link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt \
=> MD5 RFC 1321 hashes are not considered cryptographycally secure. but RFC 6151(LINK:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6151) , Updated security considerations for the MD5 message digest and the HMAC-MD5 algorithms which mentioned a number of attacks against MD5 hashes, Including the hash collision. \
=> Sha-1(Secure Hash Algorithm 1, defined by RFC 3174) when data is fed tp sha-1 hashing algorithm, sha-1 takes an input and produce a 160 bit hash value string as a 40 digit hexadecimal number. NIST deprected the use of sha-1 in 2011 and banned its use for digital signatiures at the end of 2013 based on it being susceptible to brute force attacks. Indtead NIST recommends migrating from SHA-1 to stronger hash algorithms in the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families. \
=> Study SHA-256.\
=> A hash is not considered to be cryptographically secure if two files have the same hash value or digest.

=> Various online tools can be used to do hash lookups like VirusTotal and Metadefender Cloud - OPSWAT. 
## IP addressing.
=> Attackers usually hide the malicious domains under URL shorteners.   A URL Shortener is a tool that creates a short and unique URL that will redirect to the specific website specified during the initial step of setting up the URL Shortener link. The attackers normally use the following URL-shortening services to generate malicious links: 
 
bit.ly \
goo.gl \
ow.ly \
s.id \
smarturl.it \
tiny.pl \
tinyurl.com \
x.co \
-> study: HTTP request, DNS request.
