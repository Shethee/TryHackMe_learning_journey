# Unified Kill Chain 

(LINK:https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf)

=> a framework that is used to complement other frameworks such as MITRE.

Reconnaissance:https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/

Information gathered from this phase can include:

Discovering what systems and services are running on the target, this is beneficial information in the weaponisation and exploitation phases of this section. 
Finding contact lists or lists of employees that can be impersonated or used in either a social engineering or phishing attack.
Looking for potential credentials that may be of use in later stages,  such as pivoting or initial access.
Understanding the network topology and other networked systems can be used to pivot too. 

Weaponization:https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/

Social Engineering:https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/

Getting a user to open a malicious attachment.
Impersonating a web page and having the user enter their credentials.
Calling or visiting the target and impersonating a user (for example, requesting a password reset) or being able to gain access to areas of a site that the attacker would not previously be capable of (for example, impersonating a utility engineer).

Exploitation:https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/

Uploading and executing a reverse shell to a web application.
Interfering with an automated script on the system to execute code.
Abusing a web application vulnerability to execute code on the system it is running on.

Persistence:https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/

Creating a service on the target system that will allow the attacker to regain access.
Adding the target system to a Command & Control server where commands can be executed remotely at any time.
Leaving other forms of backdoors that execute when a certain action occurs on the system (i.e. a reverse shell will execute when a system administrator logs in).

Defence Evasion:https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/

Web application firewalls.
Network firewalls.
Anti-virus systems on the target machine.
Intrusion detection systems.

Command & Control:https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/

Execute commands.
Steal data, credentials and other information.
Use the controlled server to pivot to other systems on the network.

Pivoting:https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/

"Pivoting" is the technique an adversary uses to reach other systems within a network that are not otherwise accessible (for example, they are not exposed to the internet). There are often many systems in a network that are not directly reachable and often contain valuable data or have weaker security.
