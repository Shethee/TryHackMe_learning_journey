Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) is the core security solution that a SOC analyst uses in the security operations center. \
(1) Host-Centric Log Sources
These log sources capture events that occurred within or related to the host. Devices that generate host-centric logs include Windows, Linux, servers, etc. Some examples of host-centric logs are:

. A user accessing a file \
. A user attempting to authenticate. \
. A process execution activity \
. A process adding/editing/deleting a registry key or value. \
. PowerShell execution \
(2) Network-Centric Log Sources \
Network-related logs are generated when the hosts communicate with each other or access the internet to visit a website. Devices that generate network-centric logs are firewalls, 
IDS/IPS, routers, etc. Some examples of network-centric logs are:

SSH connection \
A file being accessed via FTP \
Web traffic \
A user accessing the company's resources through VPN. \
Network file sharing Activity \
