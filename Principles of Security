#Principles of security:

CIA - Confidentiality, integrity and availability

Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals: Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (or PAM for short).Initially, these two concepts can seem to overlap; however, they are different from one another. PIM is used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system. Whereas PAM is the management of the privileges a system's access role has, amongst other things.



## The Bell-La Padula Model

The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve confidentiality. This model has a few assumptions, such as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, 
where everyone's responsibilities/roles are well-defined.
The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up".

=> Advantages are:

Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organisations hierarchies (and vice versa)

Simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful.

=> Disadvangtages are:

Even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence -- so it's not confidential in that aspect.

The model relies on a large amount of trust within the organisation.

The Bell LaPadula Model is popular within organisations such as governmental and military. This is because members of the organisations are presumed to have already gone 
through a process called vetting. Vetting is a screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to the organisation. 
Therefore, applicants who are successfully vetted are assumed to be trustworthy - which is where this model fits in.

## Biba Model

The Biba model is arguably the equivalent of the Bell-La Padula model but for the integrity of the CIA triad.

This model applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) that can be summarised as "no write up, no read down". 
This rule means that subjects can create or write content to objects at or below their level but can only read the contents of objects above the subject's level.

Advantages:
This model is simple to implement.
Resolves the limitations of the Bell-La Padula model by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity.

Disadvantages:
There will be many levels of access and objects. Things can be easily overlooked when applying security controls.
Often results in delays within a business. For example, a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model.

The Biba model is used in organisations or situations where integrity is more important than confidentiality. 
For example, in software development, developers may only have access to the code that is necessary for their job. 
They may not need access to critical pieces of information such as databases, etc. 

## Threat Modeling and incident response

Threat modeling is the process of reviewing, improving and testing the security protocols in place in an organization's information technology infrastructure and services.
The threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return to:

Preparation.
Identification.
Mitigations.
Review.

 STRIDE (Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation threats, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of privileges).

 PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis).

=> Spoofing- this principle requires you to authenticate requests and users accessing a system. Spoofing involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another. 
Access keys sych as API keys or signature via encryption helps remediate this threat.

=> Tampering- By providing anti tempering measures to a system or application, you help provide integrity to the data. Data that is accessed must be kept integral and accurate.
example: shops use seals on food products.

=> Repudiation: This principle dictates the use of services such as logging of activity for a system or application to track.

=> Information Disclosure: Applications or services that handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to only show information relevant to the owner.

=> Denial of Service: Applications and services use up system resources, 
these two things should have measures in place so that abuse of the application/service won't result in bringing the whole system down.

=> Elevation of Privilege: This is the worst-case scenario for an application or service. It means that a user was able to escalate their authorization to that of a higher level i.e. an administrator. 
This scenario often leads to further exploitation or information disclosure.
